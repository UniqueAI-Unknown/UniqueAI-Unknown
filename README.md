# MIRROR AI Lab
### Researching the Foundations of Human Intelligence

🧠 Independent research into the nature of intelligence.

MIRROR AI Lab explores **Human AI** — intelligence that understands
meaning, intent, emotional state, and context in ways that resemble human cognition.

## 🪞 MIRROR

MIRROR is an experimental research system exploring how understanding emerges
when multiple cognitive processes interact.

## 🔭 Vision

To advance intelligence that understands rather than predicts,
interprets rather than classifies,
and adapts in ways that feel natural and human.

## 🧩 Status

Independent, long-term research.  
Some work remains private. All work is intentional.

*Understanding begins where language ends.*
