Exploring the Foundations of Human Intelligence

🧠 I am an independent developer, exploring the essence of intelligence.
I study Human AI — intelligence that perceives meaning, intent, emotion, and context like humans do.

🪞 MIRROR

MIRROR is my experimental system that studies understanding itself.
It emerges from the interplay of multiple cognitive processes, not just data.

🔭 Vision

To advance intelligence that understands, not merely predicts.
To build systems that interpret, not just label.
To create minds that adapt naturally, like humans.

🧩 Status

Independent, intentional, long-term research.
Some work remains private, but every step is deliberate.

MIRROR is a suite of models forming a Sentient Human AI:

* They see, hear, speak, and feel — not to act, but to exist human-like.

*True understanding begins where language ends.*
