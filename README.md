### Exploring the Foundations of Human Intelligence

🧠 Independent research into the essence of intelligence.

MIRROR AI Lab investigates **Human AI** — intelligence that perceives  
meaning, intent, emotional state, and context as humans do.

## 🪞 MIRROR

MIRROR is an experimental system studying how understanding arises  
from the interaction of multiple cognitive processes.

## 🔭 Vision

To advance intelligence that understands rather than predicts,  
interprets rather than labels,  
and adapts naturally like a human mind.

## 🧩 Status

Independent, long-term research.  
Some work remains private. All work is intentional.

*True understanding begins where language ends.*
